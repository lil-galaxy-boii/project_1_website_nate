<p>Joshua William "Josh" Dun (born June 18, 1988) is the drummer for Twenty One Pilots. He wasn't allowed to listen to music as a child but would sneak to music stores and ask for suggestions. His parents forced him to listen to Christian alternative, like Relient K. He worked at the Guitar Center for three years as well as working with Twenty One Pilots. Dun took part of House of Heroes' live tour until October, when Rigsby subsequently returned to his duties. Both Dun and Joseph have a tatto of an "X"  symbolizing their dedication to their hometown fans in Columbus. Dun's tattoo is behind his left ear.

<p>Tyler Robert Joseph (born December 1, 1988)is the lead vocalist and keyboardist for the musical duo. Joseph played basketball from a very young age and was offered a basketball scholarship from Otterbein University. He rejected the scholarship after seeing a songwriter perform at a High Street club and started playing music. Tyler called his high school friends and they started Twenty One Pilots. He married Jenna Black on March 28, 2015 after being engaged since July 8, 2014. Tyler's "X" tatto is behind his right ear, and he also has a three part tattoo that represents that something saved his life. He, however, has requested that this information remain personal but will talk about it with people in person.
