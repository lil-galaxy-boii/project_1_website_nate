<p>Joshua William "Josh" Dun (born June 18, 1988) is the drummer for Twenty One Pilots. He wasn't allowed to listen to music as a child but would sneak to music stores and ask for suggestions. His parents forced him to listen to Christian alternative, like Relient K. He worked at the Guitar Center for three years as well as working with Twenty One Pilots. Dun took part of House of Heroes' live tour until October, when Rigsby subsequently returned to his duties. Both Dun and Joseph have a tatto of an "X"  symbolizing their dedication to their hometown fans in Columbus. Dun's tattoo is behind his left ear.
