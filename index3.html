He has alsø said that Blurryface is a character that he made up tø represent his and øther peøple’s insecurities. Tø get intø the character when he perførms, he wears black paint øn his neck and hands, which he says represents his øwn insecurities, namely feeling sufføcated (the paint øn his neck) and the things he creates with his hands (the paint øn his hands). He alsø is knøwn tø wear red armbands because red is the character’s cølør. He even kicked a persøn øut of a shøw when he saw a guy punch a girl the audience!</p>
